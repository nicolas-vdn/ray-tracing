# ray-tracing
Created a raytracing program in C following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLRLuczykM) and added a few changes

Needed dependencies :
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/download.html)
- [sdl2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation)

Compile this program with the following command :
``gcc -o raytracing raytracing.c -lm `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` ``

Or simply execute the raytracing file.
